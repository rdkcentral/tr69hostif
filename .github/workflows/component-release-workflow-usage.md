# Automated Release Workflow

Automates main release and hotfix flows via GitHub Actions.

## Workflows

### 1. Component Release (`component-release.yml`)

Triggered manually from the **Actions** tab via `workflow_dispatch`.

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `release_version` | Yes | Release version (for example: `5.2.0`, `5.2.0-rc1`) |
| `release_type` | Yes | `main` or `hotfix` |
| `release_mode` | Yes | `approvable` or `auto-complete` (ignored for hotfix) |
| `source_branch` | Hotfix only | Support branch for hotfix (for example: `support/5.0`) |

#### Concurrency

Runs are serialized per release key:

- `component-release-<release_type>-<release_version>`

This prevents two runs for the same version/type from racing on branches/tags.

#### Release Modes

**Main release - auto-complete**
1. Validates version format.
2. Runs `git flow release start` -> changelog -> `release publish` -> `release finish`.
3. Pushes `main`, `develop`, and tags.

**Main release - approvable**
1. Validates version format.
2. Runs `git flow release start` -> changelog -> `release publish`.
3. Creates a PR: `release/<version>` -> `main`.
4. Stops and waits for PR approval.
5. On approval, the second workflow finishes the release.

**Hotfix (always auto-complete)**
1. Requires `source_branch` input.
2. Validates `source_branch` against `^[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+$`.
3. Creates/uses `hotfix/<version>` from `source_branch`, updates changelog, merges back into `source_branch` only.
4. Creates tag `<version>`.
5. Pushes only `source_branch` and tag (`main`/`develop` are not pushed).

### 2. Component Release Finish On Approval (`component-release-finish-on-approval.yml`)

Triggered on approved review for `release/*` PRs targeting `main`.

#### What it does
1. Verifies PR review decision is `APPROVED`.
2. Checks out release branch.
3. Runs `git flow release finish` (merge to `main` + `develop`, create tag).
4. Pushes `main`, `develop`, and tags.
5. Deletes remote `release/<version>` branch.
6. Closes the release PR.

## Authentication and Secrets

Both workflows use:

- `RDKCM_DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH private key used by checkout and git push operations.
- `github.token`: built-in GitHub Actions token used by `gh` API/CLI calls.

Why `github.token`:

- It is automatically provided for each workflow run.
- It avoids introducing a custom repository secret for API access.
- It works with the workflow permissions already declared in these jobs.

## Failure Cleanup Safety

On failure, cleanup only removes refs created by the current run:

- Deletes tag only if the run created that tag.
- Deletes `release/<version>` only if the run created that local release branch.
- Deletes `hotfix/<version>` only if the run created that local hotfix branch.
- Skips cleanup if repository checkout is unavailable.

## Prerequisites

### Repository Settings

- **Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions**: set to **Read and write permissions**.
- **Settings -> Actions -> General**: enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**.

### Branch Protection

- For approvable flow: enforce PR review rules on `develop`.
- For auto-complete flow pushes to `develop`: ensure the automation actor has appropriate bypass rights in repository rules.

## Version Format

Accepted examples:

- `5.2.0`
- `5.2.0-rc1`
- `5.2.0v1`
- `5.2.0.beta2`

Rule: `major.minor.patch` digits with optional suffix.
